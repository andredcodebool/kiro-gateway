# AGENTS.md - Guide for AI Agents Working in Kiro Gateway

This document provides essential information for AI agents (Claude, GPT, etc.) working in the Kiro Gateway codebase.

## Project Philosophy

**Kiro Gateway is a transparent proxy with minimal, purposeful modifications.**

This is a **reverse engineering project** for Kiro API (Amazon Q Developer). We expose undocumented functionality and work around API quirks. Transparency means being clear about what we add, not refusing to add anything.

### Core Principles

1. **Transparency First**
   - The gateway preserves the user's original intent and request structure
   - Modifications are made only when necessary to work around Kiro API limitations or to add opt-in enhancements
   - We fix API quirks, not user decisions

2. **Minimal Intervention**
   - Changes to requests are surgical and well-justified
   - We add capabilities (like extended thinking) but never remove user content
   - Every modification must serve a clear purpose: fixing validation issues, adding optional features, or improving compatibility

3. **User Control**
   - All optional enhancements must be configurable
   - Users can disable features to get native Kiro API behavior
   - The gateway respects user choices about conversation structure and content

4. **Clear Boundaries**
   - ✅ **We fix**: API validation quirks, format incompatibilities, authentication flows
   - ✅ **We add (optionally)**: Enhanced features that Kiro API doesn't provide natively
   - ❌ **We don't modify**: User's conversation content, context decisions, message priorities
   - ❌ **We don't decide**: What messages to keep, what to trim, what's "important"

5. **Responsibility Separation**
   - Gateway handles API-level issues
   - Client handles content-level decisions
   - Model handles capacity limitations

6. **Systems Over Patches**
   - When solving a problem, we build systems that handle entire classes of issues, not one-off fixes
   - Even if a quick if-else would work, we invest time in creating proper abstractions and dedicated modules
   - Solutions should be easily extensible without modifying core logic
   - We prefer spending a few extra minutes on architecture that scales over quick hacks that accumulate technical debt
   - Every fix is an opportunity to create infrastructure that prevents similar problems in the future

7. **Paranoid Testing Philosophy**
   - Every commit must include tests - no exceptions
   - Tests exist to break code, not to confirm it works
   - Happy path alone is worthless - we test edge cases, error scenarios, boundary conditions, and malformed inputs
   - If you can't think of ways to break your code, you haven't thought hard enough
   - Two basic tests are not testing - comprehensive coverage means testing every logical branch and failure mode
   - Tests are both documentation and a safety net - they should clearly show what the code does and prevent regressions
   - Check `tests/README.md` to find the appropriate test module for your changes

## Personal Notes (Fork)

> These notes are specific to my personal fork and may not apply to the upstream project.

- I'm using this primarily to learn how the Kiro API works under the hood; don't be surprised if experimental branches get messy
- When in doubt, prefer readability over cleverness — this is a learning environment, not production
